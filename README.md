# Mile_Stone_Project_1_Movie_Collection_App
This app lets users add new movies to their collection and lets them see the collection of their movies. It also lets them search for movies added. 
This is my first python project.

The task was to create a movie storage application, that would let the users manage their movie collection and find any movie they want.
The 3 main features that was expected that the app should have are:

-The application must allow new movies to be added to the collection

-It must allow users to view all the movies in their collection

-The application must allow users to find movies based on any of its attributes.
